Problem Identification
======================

How do I get my team to use [insert tool here]?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Or alternatively, how do I use tool X at work? I want to stress that despite the glamor or appeal that certain tools have, you want to avoid asking yourself the wrong question when it comes to adopting the most hyped-up technologies. The field is abuzz with all sorts of news claiming that X is going to revolutionize business, whether it be data science, machine learning, generative AI, and so on, and so forth.

Yet, what is the problem you are trying to solve here? Is it to first put on the appearance of being innovative, hiring people who claim to know these things and then figuring out how to use them later? Are you trying to solve real problems that your company faces, or are you just trying to pad your resume?
