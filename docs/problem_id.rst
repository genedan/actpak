   Make it work, and then make it work better.

How do I get my team to use [insert tool here]?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Or alternatively, how do I use tool X at work? I want to stress that despite the glamor or appeal that certain tools have, you want to avoid asking yourself the wrong question when it comes to adopting the most hyped-up technologies. The field is abuzz with all sorts of news claiming that X is going to revolutionize business, whether it be data science, machine learning, generative AI, and so on, and so forth.

Yet, what is the problem you are trying to solve here? Is it to first put on the appearance of being innovative, hiring people who claim to know these things and then figuring out how to use them later? Are you trying to solve real problems that your company faces, or are you just trying to pad your resume?

I want to stress that while we live in exciting times, with all sorts of interesting technologies that promise to make our lives easier, that our primary focus is on identifying insurance problems first, and then selecting the appropriate tools to solve them second. Hence, this book will revolve around solving a common problem in insurance and then building a Python package as the tool used to solve it.

Our Representative Problem
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Throughout this book, we will be working to solve a common actuarial problem - estimating reserves. Because an in-depth guide of reserving is beyond the scope of this book (we have Friedland for that - insert citation here), we will focus on just a simplified case that can be solved with the well-known chainladder method.

Below is a triangle...

- explain solution

- now what?

Sometimes, it's OK to be old school
