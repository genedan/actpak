Introduction
============

Actuaries live in exciting times. Never before have so many tools, many of which are free and open source, been available to actuaries and related practitioners. Combined with ever-increasing, low-cost computing power, these tools have the potential to enable actuaries to apply the most cutting-edge techniques to their work.

Despite this, actuaries have struggled to encourage widespread adoption of these tools throughout the profession, and continue to face pressure to modernize their work in comparison to software engineers and data scientists. Even those actuaries who have adopted languages such as Python and R often find themselves isolated in their roles (if you are like me, oftentimes the only person within the department who knows how to program), wondering if they are keeping pace with the rest of the world.

Purpose and Intended Audience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This book aims to guide such actuaries (and related professionals) in building deployable packages in Python. The ideal reader is one who may be writing Python scripts at work but is looking to upgrade their skills into building packages. Also, those who have written packages at work but are apprehensive as to whether the quality of their work matches that of the broader community may also learn a thing or two from this book.


A Living Document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ecosystem of technologies surrounding package development is constantly changing. Between the time you have started
and finished this book, new versions of the software you use on a daily basis will have been published. Eventually these
types of changes accumulate and new practices will emerge, and existing practices may become obsolete. As the world changes,
I too, expect this paper to change to keep up with the times.

To facilitate this expectation, I will try to use as many open-source technologies as I can to write this paper. For example,
this book is written using a markup language called reStructuredText, version-controlled using Git. The subject matter
of this book, designing actuarial packages, relies on the popular programming language, Python.

However, this preference for open-source technologies is not absolute. For example, I have chosen to use the closed-source
development platform, GitHub, to host the code. This choice was made because I believe it to be the best platform for
engaging with, and accepting changes and contributions from people who may be interested in collaborating with me on this project.

Going back to the evolving nature of technology, there is no guarantee that future iterations of this paper will rely on
these same technologies. For example, there is no guarantee that Python will forever be one of the languages of choice
for actuaries, and likewise, no guarantee that Git will continue to be the version control system of choice, as these
technologies replaced those that came before them.
