Introduction
============

Actuaries live in exciting times. Never before have so many tools, many of which are free and open source, been available to actuaries and related practitioners. Combined with ever-increasing, low-cost computing power, these tools have the potential to enable actuaries to apply the most cutting-edge techniques to their work.

Despite this, actuaries have struggled to encourage widespread adoption of these tools thoughout the profession, and continue to face pressure to modernize their work in comparison to software engineers and data scientists. Even those actuaries who have adopted languages such as Python and R often find themselves isolated in their roles (if you are like me, oftentimes the only person within the department who knows how to program), wondering if they are keeping pace with the rest of the world.

Purpose and Intended Audience
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This book aims to guide such actuaries (and related professionals) in building deployable packages in Python. The ideal reader is one who may be writing Python scripts at work but is looking to upgrade their skills into building packages. Also, those who have written packages at work but are apprehensive as to whether the quality of their work matches that of the broader community may also learn a thing or two from this book.
